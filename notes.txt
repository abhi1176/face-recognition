1) Cascade Classifiers
	- Haar Feature Selection
	- Create Integral Image
	- Adaboost Training
	- Cascading Classifiers
	Pros
		Works almost real-time on CPU
		Simple Architecture
		Detects faces at different scales
	Cons
		The major drawback of this method is that it gives a lot of False predictions.
		Doesn’t work on non-frontal images.
		Doesn’t work under occlusion

2) HoG in Dlib
	Pros
		Fastest method on CPU
		Works very well for frontal and slightly non-frontal faces
		Light-weight model as compared to the other three
		Works under small occlusion
	Cons
		The major drawback is that it does not detect small faces as it is trained for minimum face size of 80×80.
			Thus, you need to make sure that the face size should be more than that in your application.
			You can however, train your own face detector for smaller sized faces.
		The bounding box often excludes part of forehead and even part of chin sometimes.
		Does not work very well under substantial occlusion
		Does not work for side face and extreme non-frontal faces, like looking down or up.

3) Convolutional Neural Network in Dlib
	Uses a Maximum-Margin Object Detector ( MMOD ) with CNN based features
	Pros
		Works for different face orientations
		Robust to occlusion
		Works very fast on GPU
		Very easy training process
	Cons
		Very slow on CPU
		Does not detect small faces as it is trained for minimum face size of 80×80.
			Thus, you need to make sure that the face size should be more than that in your application.
			You can however, train your own face detector for smaller sized faces.
		The bounding box is even smaller than the HoG detector.

4) cvlib (Tensorflow dependent)
	Underneath it is using OpenCV’s dnn module with a pre-trained caffemodel to detect faces.
	Pros
		Accurate out of all the above four methods
		Runs at real-time on CPU
		Works for different face orientations – up, down, left, right, side-face etc.
		Works even under substantial occlusion
		Detects faces across various scales ( detects big as well as tiny faces )

5) MTCNN (Tensorflow dependent)
	Pros
		Accurate out of all
		Works for different face orientations – up, down, left, right, side-face etc.
		Works even under substantial occlusion
		Detects faces across various scales ( detects big as well as tiny faces )
	Cons
		Slowest of all the above
